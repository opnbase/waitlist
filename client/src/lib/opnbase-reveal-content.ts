      content: `I was in the same situation in May of this year, it was just a disappointment to see the self-hosted version of Supabase comparing it to their cloud version, especially for a project that claims the "open source Firebase alternative", I did open many issues like this without any single response that makes sense.

Even today, the same thing is still happening, Supabase is an FIrebase alternative, not an open-source one, both keep their main features private and none of them is 100% open-source, Self-hosted Supabase is meant for testing or development, not for production.

My advice is if you need a Baas without a strong need for SQL or relations in databases, self-host Appwrite. if you want to use something non-stable but working (as I know and tried), self-host Pocket Base. if you want to use some cloud-based Baas, consider Supabase if you need Postgres in your database, otherwise just stick with Firebase.
